go-socket.io
============

The `socketio` package is a simple abstraction layer for different web browser-
supported transport mechanisms. It is fully compatible with the
[Socket.IO client](http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO) JavaScript-library by
[LearnBoost Labs](http://socket.io/). By writing custom codecs the `socketio`
could be perhaps used with other clients, too.

It provides an easy way for developers to rapidly prototype with the most
popular browser transport mechanism today:

- [HTML5 WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/)
- [Adobe® Flash® Sockets](https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js)
- [JSONP Long Polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP)
- [XHR Long Polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#XMLHttpRequest_long_polling)
- [XHR Multipart Streaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#XMLHttpRequest)
- [ActiveX HTMLFile](http://cometdaily.com/2007/10/25/http-streaming-and-internet-explorer/)

## Crash course

The `socketio` package works hand-in-hand with the standard `http` package (by
plugging itself into `http.ServeMux`) and hence it doesn't need a
full network port for itself. It has an callback-style event handling API. The
callbacks are:

- *SocketIO.OnConnect*
- *SocketIO.OnDisconnect*
- *SocketIO.OnMessage*

Other utility-methods include:

- *SocketIO.ServeMux*
- *SocketIO.Broadcast*
- *SocketIO.BroadcastExcept*
- *SocketIO.GetConn*

Each new connection will be automatically assigned an session id and
using those the clients can reconnect without losing messages: the server
persists clients' pending messages (until some configurable point) if they can't
be immediately delivered. All writes are by design asynchronous and can be made
through `Conn.Send`. The server also abstracts handshaking and various keep-alive mechanisms.

Finally, the actual format on the wire is described by a separate `Codec`. The
default bundled codecs, `SIOCodec` and `SIOStreamingCodec` are fully compatible
with the LearnBoost's [Socket.IO client](http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO)
(master and development branches).

## Example: A simple chat server

	package main

	import (
		"http"
		"log"
		"socketio"
	)

	func main() {
		sio := socketio.NewSocketIO(nil)

		sio.OnConnect(func(c *socketio.Conn) {
			sio.Broadcast(struct{ announcement string }{"connected: " + c.String()})
		})

		sio.OnDisconnect(func(c *socketio.Conn) {
			sio.BroadcastExcept(c,
				struct{ announcement string }{"disconnected: " + c.String()})
		})

		sio.OnMessage(func(c *socketio.Conn, msg socketio.Message) {
			sio.BroadcastExcept(c,
				struct{ message []string }{[]string{c.String(), msg.Data()}})
		})

		mux := sio.ServeMux()
		mux.Handle("/", http.FileServer("www/", "/"))

		if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux); err != nil {
			log.Fatal("ListenAndServe:", err)
		}
	}

## tl;dr

You can get the code and run the bundled example by following these steps:

	$ git clone git://github.com/madari/go-socket.io.git
	$ cd go-socket.io
	$ git submodule update --init --recursive
	$ make install
	$ cd example
	$ make
	$ ./example
